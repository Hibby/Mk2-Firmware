TiLDA v2 Firmware
=================

#### Back To Basics
This version of the firmware has been stripped back to, what I can see, are just the completed basics for the RTOS version of TiLDA. I can remember removing:

* EMF Radio infrastructure
  * Messaging
  * Radio Send/Receive Functions
* All Apps asides flashlight and hello world
* IRTask and FlashTask as they were empty
* SettingsStore and DataStore
* Probably lots more, there was lots of Mate involved.

My idea is to create a solid platform that anyone can build on top of when developing on the badge. Apps can take advantage of hardware as need be.
I just wanted more access to the radio and got carried away, really.

#### TODO

* Flash Storage Task
* SD Card Task
* IR Task
* Ethernet Task


#### Firmware on the TiLDA v2 Badge
* To use this code you need Arduino IDE version 1.5.7 or later which can be downloaded [here](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software#toc3).
* The easiest way to work with this repo is to set it as the sketchbook folder in the IDE's File->Preferences menu (restart the IDE after changing this setting).
* This way you will not have any conflicts with your existing sketchbook and library folders.
* N.B. Arduino 1.5.7 stores its preferences in a separate location to that of the Arduino 1.0.x IDE).
* If you're using git or your own editor, you'll need to restart the IDE after touching any file that's open. To avoid this, go to File->Preferences, and tick "Use external editor"


* The TiLDA code base is split in 3 distinct sections:
  * The custom TiLDA board definition is kept in **hardware/emfcamp/sam/**.
  * The custom TiLDA hardware libraries are kept in **hardware/emfcamp/sam/libraries** and will only be used if a TiLDA board is selected from the _Tools->Board_ menu.
  * Third is the main firmware sketch which is kept in **EMF2014/**, this has the _.ino_, _.c[pp]_ and _.h_ files for each task.
  * There may also be other examples or test sketches either in their own directory or as examples in TiLDA library folders.


#### hardware/
* This folder contains _TiLDA Mk2_ board definition for use with the Arduino IDE (version -> 1.5.7).
* To use: copy the **emfcamp** folder to your **~/sketchbook/hardware/** folder.
* You can then select _TiLDA Mk2_ from the _Tools->Board_ menu.
* To use the **FTDI** upload port you will need to manually erase the board before uploading a new sketch (short the **Erase** pins for 1 second).

#### Tilda/
* This is the main sketch for the EMF 2014 firmware.
* It is complied using the **TiLDA Mk2** board form the the _Tools->Board_ menu.
* void setup() and void loop() can be found in EMF2014.ino
* There are several _.c[pp]_ and _.h_ files that make up the _FreeRTOS_ tasks used by the main app.
